# OpenCrashWOC
An open source, reverse engineered re-implementation of Crash Bandicoot: Wrath Of Cortex.

## Notice
We love Crash Bandicoot! If you plan to play this, you must legally dump assets from your GameCube disk, and please buy one of the latest Crash games to show your support! OpenCrashWOC is a fan reverse-engineered version of CrashWOC without having any access or knowledge of the original game code. While the functions mostly match in utility, any identicality to the originals are pure coincidence. This is not a decompilation, but rather a complete rewrite from the ground up of the entire game. Not a single asset from the original game is present.

## Other Notice
This README will be more complete and detailed with instructions to contribute, build, and play once they exist!
